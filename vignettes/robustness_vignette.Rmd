## Introduction

### What is DAISIErobustness?
DAISIErobustness is an R package for testing of the robustness of the island biogeography model "[DAISIE](https://github.com/rsetienne/DAISIE)" (_Dynamical Assembly of Islands by Speciation, Immigration and Extinction_)  to more complex and potentially more realistic evolutionary models. Different measures of error of number of species, endemics, non-endemics and evolutionary trajectories are used to determine whether the alternative models can influence the inference capabilities of the current DAISIE model.

### DAISIErobustness pipeline
DAISIErobustness consists of a pipeline designed to measure the error one creates when extending the standard DAISIE model with new features. Examples of such new additions include the modelling of island ontogeny, as per the General Dynamic Model<sup>1</sup>, sea level changes<sup>2</sup>, and non-oceanic scenarios. The error measure is obtained by simulating and comparing DAISIE data using simulation code that builds upon the existing DAISIE simulations by including geodynamic processes.

## Usage
### Running the pipeline
The full pipeline can be called by the external function `run_robustness()`. If the `save_output` argument is set to `TRUE`, a folder named results will be created in the current working directory, into which a folder named after the selected parameter space with an .RData file will be saved. This file .RData will contain the results for all the replicates of a given parameter set. If `save_output` is set to `FALSE`, the results object will be returned and not saved to a file.
```{r eval = FALSE, run_robustness}
library(DAISIErobustness)
run_robustness(
  param_space_name = "nonoceanic",
  param_set = 1,
  replicates = 2,
  distance_method = "abs",
  save_output = FALSE
)
```
