# DAISIErobustness

DAISIErobustness is an R package allowing the testing the robustness of the island biogeography model "[DAISIE](https://github.com/rsetienne/DAISIE)" (_Dynamical Assembly of Islands by Speciation, Immigration and Extinction_)  to more complex and potentially more realistic evolutionary models.

DAISIE allows for the estimation of diversification rates and other relevant diversification parameters on islands. These are:
* Cladogenesis rate
* Anagenesis rate
* Carrying capacity (clade-specific or island-wide)
* Migration rate
* Extinction

The estimation of such parameters is achieved using Maximum-Likelihood optimization, following the DAISIE likelihood functions described in published literature<sup>1</sup>.
