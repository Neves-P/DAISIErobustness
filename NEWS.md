# DAISIErobustness 1.0.0

* Package to test the robustness of island biogeography models.
* Simulate new geodynamics and trait dependent models using the
DAISIE model.
* Pipeline to analyse the robustness of the DAISIE ML inference to the newly 
implemented models.
* Can read any new model input in the DAISIE format regardless of generating 
model from a file.
* Store intermediate simulation output and read said output to finish analyses
and save to file.
* Interact and submit jobs to the Pergrine HPCC at the RUG.
* Generate parameter spaces used for geodynamics and trait dependence robustness
studies.
