Calculating the likelihood for the initial parameters. 
The loglikelihood for the initial parameter values is -151.2249 
Optimizing the likelihood - this may take a while. 
Positive values of loglik encountered without possibility for approximation. Setting loglik to -Inf.
An approximation of logcond must be made. Results may be unreliable.
